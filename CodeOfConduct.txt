-Use === instead of == in most cases
-One class per file
-Captilize class names
-Prefix private members in classes with m
-Use getters/setters for members in classes. But don't, please program object oriented :)
-Use 'this' for getting a reference to your class in it's methods
-Try to always have a return value for methods
-Have fun!

Philosophy:
A simple 2d game engine, encouraging object-oriented programming and giving developers many freedoms/not being limited by a framework
