Collisions
Define resources in text file
Work on input events, Use events, don't get out of them! (more responsive, right?)
Access to mouse drag
Detect button presses (down and up, like a click)
Audio (Audio API, probably)
Better buttons. The ability to give it a variable where it would keep the button's state (for the buttons that have one)
Time-based animations and movement, not frame-base!
Long-shot: Optimize context style transformations with a system. (complex)
NOTE: Stop ignoring jQuery, and get that corss-browser goodness!
Only us mousedown and mouseup? Way more responsive!
No direct access to members?
Don't redraw when there is no movement
Implement Box2d - with slow motion

Test: Shooter with ragdolls?

Checklist:
Sprite physics: keep points in definition. Fine with complex things like cars, it's going to use box2d handle.
Piece of paper!

Do the update TODO!!!!!
Camera controls and locking on sprite
Resource loading
Input
Input Validation (+error messages, throw new Error("Error message");)

BONUS:Universal level editor (with game engine!)
